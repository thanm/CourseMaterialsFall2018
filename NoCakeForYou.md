# Challenge problem: Cake Defense

Write a program with three sprites: a birthday cake, the Alonso character, and a bat. 

The cake sits in the middle of the stage and does nothing. 

The Alonso sprite tracks the mouse -- wherever the mouse goes, he goes as well (stopping at the border of the stage).

The bat plays "cake defense" -- write code to position the bat between Alonso and the cake, equidistant from each one (the bat doesn't want Alonso to have any cake, so it tries to put itself in the way).

As an additional requirement, write custom blocks to return the x and y positions of Alonso and the bat.
